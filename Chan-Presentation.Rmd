# Filtering out all options that are unnecessary

# Gas Vehicle Fuel Efficency

## Dataset
- Data is from United States Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency
- The dataset contains all the car manufactures makes and models that are sold in the US
- This dataset is constantly being updated with new makes and models and contains over 43,000 different types of makes and models from 1984 to 2021. 
- The dataset includes a data dictionary that can be found on the [United States of Energy Fuel Economy](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/ws/index.shtml#vehicle)
- In the dataset we will be strictly looking at only gas engine cars and will be filtering out hybrids, diesel, and electric cars. 

## Question

Has fuel economy peaked throughout the years. 

- Increase fuel economy regulations from the EPA and government
- Improvement in gas engine technology
- Improvement to aero dynamics of vehicles.

## Looking at the data

Can see a positive trend and see that the minimum MPG has been increasing throughout the years, but has MPG peaked ?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
dataset %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=highway08)) + geom_point() + geom_jitter() + ylab('Highway MPG')
```

## Loess Regression

- Loess Regression is a smoothing technique which uses the local weights of each value in order to create a regression line
- The Loess Regression relies on different span sizes in order to get different levels of smoothing

## Loess Regression Highway Fuel Economy

```{r, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
m1 = loess(highway08 ~ year, data=dataset, span=0.05)
m2 = loess(highway08 ~ year, data=dataset, span=0.15)
m3 = loess(highway08 ~ year, data=dataset, span=0.50)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=dataset, aes(x=year, y=m1$fitted)) + geom_line(color='RED') + geom_line(aes(x=year, y=m2$fitted), color='BLUE') + geom_line(aes(x=year, y=m3$fitted), color='GREEN') + ylab('Highway MPG')
```

## Loess Regression City Fuel Economy

```{r, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
m4 = loess(city08 ~ year, data=dataset, span=0.05)
m5 = loess(city08 ~ year, data=dataset, span=0.15)
m6 = loess(city08 ~ year, data=dataset, span=0.50)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=dataset, aes(x=year, y=m4$fitted)) + geom_line(color='RED') + geom_line(aes(x=year, y=m5$fitted), color='BLUE') + geom_line(aes(x=year, y=m6$fitted), color='GREEN') + ylab('City MPG')
```

## Loess Regression Fuel Economy

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=dataset, aes(x=year)) + geom_line(aes(y=m3$fitted), color='GREEN') + geom_line(aes(y=m6$fitted), color='BLUE') + ylab('MPG')
```

## GGPairs

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
dataset %>%
  select('city08', 'highway08', 'cylinders', 'displ', 'fuelType', 'year') %>%
  ggpairs()
```

## Linar Regression: City Fuel Economy

```{r, echo=FALSE}
m7 = lm(city08 ~ cylinders + displ, data = dataset)
summary(m7)
```

## Linear Regression: City Fuel Economy

```{r, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(m7)
```

## Linear Regression: Highway Fuel Economy

```{r, echo=FALSE}
m8 = lm(highway08 ~ cylinders + displ, data = dataset)
summary(m8)
```

## Linear Regression: Highway Fuel Economy
```{r, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(m8)
```

## Conclusion

- Fuel economy is affected by the economy which also effects gas prices and consumer spending
- Fuel economy ias indeed plateaued in recent years due to consumers buying more SUVs
  + Auto manufactures like Ford and General Motors are no longer making any more sedans
- Would like to see how COVID and the recession will impact the fuel economy
